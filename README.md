# DotNet Go Lynx

Golinks implementation in .NET!

### What

Go links are a popular internal corporate url shortener system. Instead of going to https://confluence.internal.domain.corp.local/this/isan/obnoxious/url/tofind/each/time/youneed/it/ugh you can use go/wiki instead!

### Why?

My company didn't have one and it sounded like a fun learning experiment.

### What can it do?

Like any URL shortener, it can take a valid URL string (anything other than ``{} | ^ ~ [] ` ; /\ ? : @ # = % & <>`` and `spaces`). This includes emoji üëç! You can add and delete URLs as much as you like.

## Contributing

PRs accepted! Please make sure your code follows the editorconfig in the repository and otherwise adheres to standard C# development practices.

## Running

GoLynx is designed to be deployed as a docker container with a SQLite database file located nearby, preferably in a mounted volume of some sort. Add a DNS CNAME entry for your default DNS resolution domain for `go`, such as `go.contoso.local`, directing to wherever you've hosted the app. At that point you're off to the races.

‚ö† Keep in mind that this is effectively a wide open DNS resolver. **You really should avoid running this on unsecured networks.** It can be used for all sorts of phishing and reflection attacks. You have been warned.

### Configuration

This app is configured via appsettings.json. You can find an example (with details you should fill out) provided in the repo that you can either edit directly, or provide an override file in the same directory called appsettings.release.json.

The basic structure looks like this and is explained section by section below.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    ...
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Authentication": {
    ...
  }
}
```

#### ConnectionStrings

This section contains the connection string to connect to the appropriate SQL data store. There should only be one connection string at a time, the app doesn't know what to do with more than one.

The database provider is chosen based on the name of the connection string key provided. You should provide a connection string in the format appropriate for the provide you select. The key must match with one of the implemented providers:

* DefaultConnection: Alias for Sqlite.
* Sqlite: For a local (or volume-mapped) SQLite database. Good for home installations.
    * Example: `"Sqlite": "Data Source=redirects.db"`
* SqlServer: For an MS SQL Server connection.
    * Example: `"SQLServer": "server=127.0.0.1,1433;Database=netgolynx;User Id=SA;Password=yourStrong(!)Password"`
* Postgresql: For a PostgreSQL server connection.
    * Example: `"PostgreSQL": "Host=localhost;Database=netgolynx;Username=postgres;Password=password"`

NetGoLynx is configured to fire off database migrations automatically when the app starts to make sure the database is present and the schema is up to date. If there are any breaking schema changes that requires any kind of manual migration the release notes will walk you through the operations necessary.

There is no mechanism for migrating between database providers at this time, taking a backup of the existing provider and loading it into a new provider after running NetGoLynx once may just work. Alternatively pester me to implement full import/export or something.

#### Logging

Control how noisy the logging system is to the log file.

#### AllowedHosts

Leave it as "*".

#### Authentication

Configure the available authentication providers.

##### GitHub

Authenticate using a GitHub app. You can configure this to be either GitHub.com or a GitHub Enterprise instance. Follow the [instructions for creating a GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) to get the ClientId and ClientSecret. You'll need to update the URLs for the various endpoints if you're using GitHub Enterprise.

The GitHub App's redirect URL will be `<your host>/_/api/v1/account/signin-github`.

Example with the appropriate URLs for github.com:

```json
    "GitHub": {
      "ClientId": "Paste your client ID here",
      "ClientSecret": "Paste your client secret here",
      "AuthorizationEndpoint": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
      "TokenEndpoint": "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
      "UserInformationEndpoint": "https://api.github.com/user",
      "UserEmailsEndpoint": "https://api.github.com/user/emails"
    }
```

##### Google

Authenticate using Google authentication. You'll need to follow the process to create a [Google OAuth App](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) and you _absolutely_ must use an HTTPS endpoint for this app. This can make supporting the go/ dns serch domain tricky. Good luck.

The Google App's redirect URL will be `<your host>/_/api/v1/account/signin-google`.

```json
    "Google": {
      "ClientId": "Paste your client ID here",
      "ClientSecret": "Paste your client secret here"
    }
```

##### Okta

Authenticate using an Okta account. You'll need to create an OAuth2 app in your Okta developer console (not the Admin console) following [the guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/create-oauth-app/). The only allowed grant type that is required is Authorization Code, the rest can be unchecked.

The Okta App's redirect URL will be `<your host>/_/api/v1/account/signin-okta`.

The OktaDomain needs to be your Okta account's Organization URL. You can find it by visiting your developer dashboard and looking in the top-right. Don't include a trailing slash!

If you are using Custom Authorization Servers this may not work out of the box for you. Please file an issue or otherwise let me know that this is a feature you need and I can easily add in support for it. [The API URLs change slightly when using a Custom Auth Server.](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/)

```json
    "Okta": {
      "ClientId": "Paste your client ID here",
      "ClientSecret": "Paste your client secret here",
      "OktaDomain": "https://some-okta-account.okta.com"
    }
```

An example configuration all together:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=redirects.db"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Authentication": {
    "GitHub": {
      "ClientId": "This is very not real",
      "ClientSecret": "Also not real!",
      "AuthorizationEndpoint": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
      "TokenEndpoint": "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
      "UserInformationEndpoint": "https://api.github.com/user",
      "UserEmailsEndpoint": "https://api.github.com/user/emails"
    },
    "Okta": {
      "ClientId": "This is not very real!",
      "ClientSecret": "Still not real at all!",
      "OktaDomain": "URL of your okta account with no trailing slash!"
    }
  }
}
```
